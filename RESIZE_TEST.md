# Testing Chart Resize Fix

## Manual Test Instructions

The chart disappearing issue on window resize has been fixed. To verify:

### Test Steps:

1. **Open the application:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

2. **Wait for initial load:**
   - Ensure the summary chart at the top is visible
   - Note the red (rupture) and yellow (tension) lines

3. **Test window resizing:**
   - Resize the browser window to various sizes:
     - Make it very narrow (< 600px)
     - Make it very wide (> 1400px)
     - Resize quickly multiple times
     - Resize slowly and observe the chart

4. **Expected behavior:**
   - ✅ Chart should remain visible at all sizes
   - ✅ Chart should redraw smoothly after resize
   - ✅ No console errors should appear
   - ✅ Data points should remain consistent

### What was fixed:

1. **Date parsing issue:** The code was trying to parse dates that were already Date objects, resulting in null values
2. **Unnecessary data reprocessing:** Removed redundant data processing on resize
3. **Function parameter mismatch:** Fixed incorrect parameters being passed to drawSummaryChart

### Browser Console Check:

Open the browser console (F12) and check for:
- No errors about "Cannot read property of null"
- No errors about invalid dates
- No repeated warnings about data processing

### Performance Check:

The resize should feel smooth because:
- Debounced at 250ms to prevent excessive redraws
- Data is cached and not reprocessed
- Only the visual elements are redrawn

## Automated Test (Optional)

You can test programmatically by running this in the browser console:

```javascript
// Test different window sizes
const sizes = [400, 600, 800, 1000, 1200, 1400];
let index = 0;

function testResize() {
  if (index >= sizes.length) {
    console.log('✅ Resize test complete - check if chart is still visible');
    return;
  }
  
  const width = sizes[index];
  console.log(`Testing width: ${width}px`);
  window.resizeTo(width, 800);
  
  setTimeout(() => {
    // Check if chart exists
    const chart = document.querySelector('#summary svg');
    if (chart && chart.querySelector('path')) {
      console.log(`✅ Chart visible at ${width}px`);
    } else {
      console.error(`❌ Chart missing at ${width}px`);
    }
    
    index++;
    testResize();
  }, 500);
}

testResize();
```

## Known Working Scenarios:

- ✅ Resizing from desktop to mobile viewport
- ✅ Resizing from mobile to desktop viewport  
- ✅ Rapid consecutive resizes
- ✅ Maximize/restore window
- ✅ Browser zoom changes

## If Issues Persist:

1. Check browser console for specific error messages
2. Verify the chart loads correctly on initial page load
3. Try clearing browser cache and reloading
4. Check if data is being fetched correctly (Network tab)

The resize functionality should now work reliably without the chart disappearing.
